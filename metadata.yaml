description: "The Old English Baron is an early Gothic novel by the English author\
  \ Clara Reeve. It was first published under this title in 1778, although it had\
  \ anonymously appeared in 1777 under its original name of The Champion of Virtue,\
  \ before Samuel Richardson's daughter, Mrs Bridgen, had edited it for her. Apart\
  \ from typographical errors, the revision was trifling.\nMiss Reeve noted in the\
  \ 1778 preface that\n\n\"This Story is the literary offspring of The Castle of Otranto,\
  \ written upon the same plan, with a design to unite the most attractive and interesting\
  \ circumstances of the ancient Romance and modern Novel, at the same time it assumes\
  \ a character and manner of its own, that differs from both; it is distinguished\
  \ by the appellation of a Gothic Story, being a picture of Gothic times and manners.\"\
  \n\nOriginally Miss Reeve presented the story, as Walpole had done before her, as\
  \ an old manuscript she had merely discovered and transcribed. Under Mrs Bridgen's\
  \ auspices this fiction was removed from the preface, but more subtle textual references\
  \ to its authenticity were allowed to remain. These included the claim that the\
  \ four-year interval was a lacuna in the manuscript, where the original author was\
  \ suppose to have left off and a \"more modern hand\" continued the manuscript;\
  \ there are many subsequent breaches in the narrative where the original was supposed\
  \ to have been defaced by damp.\n\nThe Oxford World's Classics edition notes that\
  \ it was a major influence in the development of Gothic fiction. It was dramatized\
  \ in 1799 as Edmond, Orphan of the Castle.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
